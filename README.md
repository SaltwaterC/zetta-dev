# Zetta

Zetta is a standalone, cross-platform terminal emulator built with Rust,
GPUI, and Zed's terminal engine (alacritty_terminal). It combines a
GPU-rendered terminal with the tabs, panes, profiles, and configurable
shortcuts expected from a complete terminal application.

Zetta currently supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. All platforms are targets
for active development.

## Highlights

- Tabs with renameable titles and selectable icons, recursive pane splits and
  pane rotation, pane templates, pane minimization, input broadcasting, and
  modal keyboard or mouse pane resizing
- Automatically detected shells, including Homebrew-installed shells on
  macOS and Linux, plus first-class WSL/MSYS2 profiles with working directory
  tracking
- Detachable background sessions that can survive after the last window closes
- Open paths or the complete pane scrollback in `$EDITOR`, with built-in vi as
  the fallback
- Native command, path, and SSH-alias completion in a multi-command prompt
- Typed settings and keymap editor, per-profile themes, and installable Zed
  themes
- Serial consoles plus built-in HTTP and TFTP tools, usable from panes or the
  CLI
- Cross-platform desktop notifications from the CLI
- A small syntax-highlighted built-in [vi editor](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/busy-v),
  available as `zetta vi`, unconditionally as `zvi`, and conditionally as `vi`
  through shell integration;
  see the [supported grammars](docs/usage.md#built-in-vi-syntax-highlighting)

## Quick start

Initialize the Zed submodule, then run Zetta with the pinned Rust toolchain:

```sh
git submodule update --init
cargo run
```

Linux defaults to Wayland. Use `make build X11=1` to include the X11 backend
as well. Linux system dependencies and platform-specific build and desktop
installation instructions are in the [installation guide](docs/installation.md).

Corporate or otherwise restricted deployments can omit the serial console,
network tools, and desktop notifications at build time. For example, `make
build SERIAL=0 HTTP=0 TFTP=0 NOTIFY=0` produces a terminal-only build.
`TFTP_SERVER=0` and `TFTP_CLIENT=0` control the two TFTP components
independently. Set `SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING=0` to omit the optional bundled
Tree-sitter grammar set from the vi editor. The flags also accept `false`,
`no`, or `off`.

The tools are available directly when enabled: `zetta serial console --device
PATH`, `zetta http server`, `zetta tftp server`, and `zetta notify`.
From a Zetta pane, `zetta tabicon ICON` changes the active tab icon.
Shell integration completes the current serial-device and tab-icon lists
dynamically. See [Serial and network tools](docs/tools.md) for flags and safety
notes.

## Multi-command prompt

Press `Ctrl-Shift-M` and enter a command such as:

```sh
ssh {{dev,prod}}-{{eu,us}}.example.com
```

Zetta expands the Cartesian product, tiles the active pane, and runs one
command in each new pane. The prompt completes executables from `PATH`, paths
relative to the active pane, and SSH aliases from `~/.ssh/config`; use `Tab`
and `Shift-Tab` to cycle completions.

## Built with Codex and GPT-5.6

Zetta was developed using Codex with GPT-5.6. Codex accelerated the project
from an experimental question—whether Zed's terminal could become a standalone
application—into a working cross-platform terminal emulator in a short
development cycle. It implemented the application, the local terminal and
platform forks, tests, documentation, and iterative fixes through the Codex
TUI.

The project was self-hosted early: development continued inside Zetta using the
Codex TUI before the first commit was made. That provided a practical feedback
loop in which terminal interaction, rendering, panes, profiles, and
cross-platform behavior could be exercised while the application itself was
being built.

The key product and engineering decisions remained human-led. These included
the cross-platform terminal workflow, feature priorities, interaction design,
application architecture, testing strategy, and the boundaries between Zetta's
code, its maintained forks, and upstream Zed. Codex handled implementation and
rapid iteration; decades of day-to-day terminal use guided what should be
built, how it should behave, and when the result was good enough.

  integration
- [Using Zetta](docs/usage.md): tabs, panes, search, shortcuts, and pane
  templates
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md): settings, profiles, keymaps, fonts,
  and themes
- [Background sessions](docs/background-sessions.md): detach, protect, inspect,
  and reconnect sessions

  stress workloads, and diagnostics

Use [`config.example.json`](config.example.json) and
[`keymap.example.json`](keymap.example.json) as starting points for local
customization.

## Design philosophy

Zetta favors useful conventions and a consistent experience across platforms,
while retaining configuration where users' established terminal muscle memory
differs. It aims to work out of the box, even when that means bundling assets
such as the MesloLGS NF font family.

The project's terminal-view fork retains Zed's GPU renderer and terminal
interaction without bringing along the rest of the editor.

The name combines Zeta and tty—though it also happens to describe the size of
some Rust binaries.
